# Payment Integration Removal Notes

## Changes Made

The payment integration has been temporarily removed from the application while keeping all the code for future implementation. Here's what was changed:

### 1. API Routes
- **`app/api/user/route.ts`**: Payment order creation disabled, returns success message
- **`app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts`**: Razorpay webhook disabled, returns success message

### 2. Components
- **`components/home/price-card.tsx`**: "Buy Now" button now redirects to `/upload` instead of triggering payment
- **`components/dashboard/upgrade-banner.tsx`**: Shows "Unlimited Access" instead of remaining documents
- **`components/common/header.tsx`**: Removed "Pro" indicator
- **`components/home/pricing-section.tsx`**: Updated to show all features are free

### 3. Utilities
- **`utils/user-subscribe.ts`**: Always returns success, giving all users access to all features

### 4. Database Schema
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: Payment model commented out (but preserved)

### 5. Libraries
- **`lib/razorpay.ts`**: Razorpay configuration commented out

## Current State

✅ **All features are now available for free**
✅ **Pricing UI is preserved and functional**
✅ **All payment code is preserved (commented)**
✅ **No payment dependencies removed from package.json**

## To Re-enable Payment Integration Later

1. **Uncomment the Payment model** in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Uncomment Razorpay imports** in `lib/razorpay.ts`
3. **Uncomment payment logic** in `app/api/user/route.ts`
4. **Uncomment webhook logic** in `app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts`
5. **Update `utils/user-subscribe.ts`** to use actual payment status
6. **Update pricing cards** to trigger payment instead of redirecting
7. **Update upgrade banner** to show actual remaining documents
8. **Run database migration** to add Payment table back

## Environment Variables (Keep for Later)

Keep these environment variables for when payment is re-enabled:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_KEY_ID`
- `TEST_KEY_SECRET`
- `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Notes

- All users now have unlimited access to all features
- The pricing section still shows both Basic and Pro plans for UI consistency
- Payment-related code is preserved and commented for easy restoration
- No breaking changes to the core application functionality
